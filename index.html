Let me start by saying that I started to code for the sole purpose of making money online. If you join sites online that pay you for micro jobs, you may have noticed that you can get paid for getting other people to sign up. These type of sites provide links called affiliate links, that you can share online to earn extra income when people click the link and sign up. You can maximize your earnings on these sites by having your own webpage where your affiliate links are listed, like this one that I have created. However, if you create your own website, many web host limit your ability to design with templates that I find to be annoying. That is where learning how to code comes into play.
